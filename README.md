## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

* Showcase Mexican cuisine - highlight the rich and diverse flavors of Mexican cuisine through engaging visuals and descriptions.

* Provide a seamless user experience - design an intuitive and user-friendly website structure with easy navigation between pages. 

* Encourage customer engagement - include clear calls-to-action, inviting visitors to explore the menu, make reservations or get in touch. 

* Generate interest and drive traffic - optimize the website for search engines to increase visibility and attract customers. 

### User Stories

* As a customer, I want to be able to navigate the website intuitively and learn more about the restaurant.

* As a customer, I want to be able to read more about the food and cocktail options available.

* As a customer, I want to easily find the contact information for the business.

* As a customer, I want to find social media links to the business.

* As a customer, I want to be able to book a reservation directly from the website.

* As a customer, I want to easily find the business' location.

### Color Scheme
![Color scheme image](assets/readme-files/colour-scheme.png)

The colors used in the site are red (#784742), yellow (#E5B87B), two shades of green (#56733C and #FAFCF7) and the colour white for the main background. These colours represent Cinco de Mayo, a celebration of Mexico. I recreated the Mexican flag in the navigation bar and footer elements. A shade of gold is used instead of white, as I wanted the colour to stand out more against a light clean background. For the menu section, the left side is red and the right side is green, consistent with the Las Tacos logo. The desserts heading is in gold to give the menu the complete colour selection and highlight desserts as an indulgent and luxury item.

### Typography

I want the site to have both an authentic and modern feel. Amatic SC is used for the headings, which gives the site a friendly and informal vibe. It evokes a sense of traditional Mexican art, adding a touch of authenticity to the site. It is also used for the logo, reinforcing the Las Tacos brand. The main font used in the site is Lato, with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case Lato is not being imported correctly. The combination of Amatic SC and Lato creates a cohesive visual identity. 

### Wireframes

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create a layout of the website in the planning phase. Here are my initial designs for the layout. 

Page | Desktop Version | Mobile Version
